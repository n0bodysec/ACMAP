# ACMAP
(Unofficial **ACM**arket **A**PI written in **P**HP).

ACMAP is a simple PHP API for the Android Market App called "ACMarket". This API isn't finished.

### Why?
I don’t like to install apps like ACMarket on my device so I had the ~~brilliant~~ idea to develop an “API” that let me use most of the app functions without the app itself.

### Credits

People that made this possible:

* [ACMarket Team](https://www.acmarket.net/) - The Android app itself (?)
* [PHP Team](https://www.php.net/) - For PHP duh
